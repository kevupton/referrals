## Referrals ##
Laravel Referral System integration. 

### How it works ###
This referral system is based of queue jumping. The idea being that when someone signs up they are placed into a queue.
Then whenever someone registers, they jump **X** places in the queue. 
The idea behind the queue itself is that it is to slowly grow over a period of time, to simulate users signing up, and hence a demand. Or a queue to jump.
